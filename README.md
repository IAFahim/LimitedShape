GOEDWARE GAME JAM LIMITED SHAPES SPECIAL EDITION THEME + SHAPES

It is always difficult to find a good theme. It should give you a push in the right direction for a game idea, but it shouldn't be too limiting either. We think we found that in the following theme:

"LIMITED SPACE"

Some inspiration: The theme LIMITED SPACE challenges you to think about boundaries, restrictions, and how to do more with less. Space could be physical like fitting shapes into a tight area, moving within a shrinking arena, or designing a world inside a single room. It could also be abstract: limited inventory, limited choices, or limited time to act.

Whether it’s puzzles, action, strategy, or narrative, the fun lies in how you make players adapt when their options are constrained. Combine this with the allowed shapes and see how creative you can be within those limits!

ALLOWED SHAPES (SEE IMAGE)

You may only use the following shapes in your game (just one, or all of them):

Circle (2D): must be a perfect round (no ellipses).
Regular Pentagon (2D): all sides and angles the same (no stretched or skewed versions).
Sphere (3D): must be a perfect ball (no ellipsoids).
Right Square Pyramid (3D):  must have a square base with the top point exactly in the center (height may vary, but no tilted or off-center tips).

We selected these shapes to strike a balance: challenging enough to inspire creative solutions, but still accessible for beginners and easy to judge fairly across all submissions.

Good luck and most importantly have fun creating during this Game Jam!

P.S. You can create the shapes however you like. For example: use your game engine to generate spheres, a modeling tool like Blender for the pyramid and/or your favorite image editor to design the circle and pentagon sprites. We’ve provided a small sample pack with a FBX model of a pyramid and some PNG files for the circle and pentagon.
